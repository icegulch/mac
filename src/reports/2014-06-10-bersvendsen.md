<p>Thanks for the challenge, it made me go for an adventure. I might have taken a wrong turn somewhere since my distance and total elevation gain where higher than the 5.3 mi and 4488 in the invite?</p>
<p>Here is the link to my trace.</p>
<p>Loved every stepâ€¦ even coming down and celebrating Independence Day.</p>
<p>Thanks for the beverage! I might try to improve my time later in the season and let you know.</p>
