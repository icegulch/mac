<p>I finally made the trip north for the MAC this morning. This was supposed to be a casual recon trip for a more serious attempt in August, but at some point I realized I could finish in under two hours, so I picked up the pace a little.</p>
<p>It's a geat route. I hadn't been on that section of Scar Trail before, or Gulfside, for that matter. The Watson Path junction with Valley Way had a large group sitting all around the sign post and on the Watson Path. I went down far enough to realize my mistake, but not terribly far.</p>
<p>I had forgotten just how crazy the parking situation is at Appalachia. Holy smokes! I arrived at 7:00 and found cars already 100 yards down the road.</p>
