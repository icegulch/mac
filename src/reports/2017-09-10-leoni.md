<p>I just finished the mount Adams challenge with Jess Marion.  This is her 4 or 5th time but my first.  She beat me up by about 45 seconds.  Real slippery and cold in the clouds on top but still rewarding.  I probably won't make it into WMC or Saalt today but I'll be back!</p>
<p>Thanks for the challenge!</p>
