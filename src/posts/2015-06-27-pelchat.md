<p>Nice going, Mount Washington State Park Manager Mike Pelchat! Mike tackled the Mount Adams Challenge on June 27th and did it in style, completing it in 1:43:28. Writing about it on Facebook, Mike said, “The object is to run a set of trails to summit of Mt Adams in under 2hrs., 10min. Its mostly hiking as fast as one can. Fitbit time was off compared to MapMyRun on IPhone. Lots of people above tree line. It was a fun challenge!” Mike's training? He had run the Mount Washington Road Race the weekend prior!</p>
