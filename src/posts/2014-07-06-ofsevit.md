<p>The Mount Adams Challenge was great fun! I'd thought for a while that having an informal race to a hut would be a good time, this was basically that. 1:49:06 from sign to sign, and I'd never even been on the Scar Trail (I worked a summer at Madisonâ€”I have no excuse except that I was usually hiking by it with 50 or 60 pounds on my back). There's a Strava segment for it now and I beat my friend by 9 seconds (although he didn't start his timer quite right).</p>
<p>I might even try it again (my best Valley Way time was on a nice cool day in 1:09) and will certainly encourage friends to do so as well.</p>
<p>Best,
Ari</p>
