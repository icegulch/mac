<p>Fueled by a brownie from White Mountain Cafe, Jess Marion and myself (Lincoln Benedict) met the 2:10 goal.</p>
<p>We missed the turnoff onto watson but turned around soon enough. Think we lost 5-10 on that one. I must have bumped my watch somewhere past the junction of airline and gulfside as it stopped so the 1:33 isn't accurate. I think my time was actually I think around 1:42 as I'd guestimate I was about 4:00 ahead of Jess though I think that could have been possible if we hadn't turned the wrong way! If you look at Strava its 1:49 as I think I went across the “start line” to go to the bathroom before we started. Whatever- I'll call it 1:49! Jess did it in a pretty kick ass 1:46- not bad considering she got blown over on her way to the summit with the crazy gusty winds.</p>
<p>So:
Jess Marion (1:46)
Lincoln Benedict (1:49)</p>
<p>Woo hoo- and had a great dinner at Saalt to top it all off. Thanks guys- fun to do something different!</p>
<p>Lincoln</p>
