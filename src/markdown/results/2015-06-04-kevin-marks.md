<p>On June 4th, three of us attempted the Mt Adams vertical challenge as part of a larger vertical training day: Andy Kernytsky, Kevin Marks, and myself, Jeff Hixon made the trek. Here's our story:</p>
<p>We set out on the prescribed routes at about 9 AM after a drive up from Boston.  It was a very nice day on the mountains after the morning fog and clouds lifted and we had a very pleasant trip up Adams.  We had several navigational â€˜pauses' due to our relative unfamiliarity with the route (It had been a few years since I've been over that way &amp; first time for Kevin and Andy) but we did manage to make it in 2:02!  We did not push the pace, as we were continuing on for the rest of the day with a few more ascents, along with the nav pauses, but it will leave us with a time to beat for next time!</p>
<p>Attached are our GPS logs and a few pics form the summit!</p>
<p>Thanks for doing this, it was a great time and provided us a little extra motivation on our first ascent of the day!!</p>
<p>Best,
Jeff, on behalf of Kevin and Andy as well</p>
