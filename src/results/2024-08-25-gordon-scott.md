After a three year hiatus, I took a shot at the MAC again. This was my eighth time finishing on eight attempts but I really pushed it close to the wire today. 2:07:50 AND I missed the Watson Path turn which probably cost me 3 minutes, almost enough to push me over the limit. 

A glorious day for a long trail run in the Northern Presidentials and this was the perfect opportunity to try the MAC again as part of it.
