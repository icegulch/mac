oof that was hard. My HR was way higher than expected from the start -- I knew I was in for a sufferfest. Sun beat me up on this one. No wind above tree line didnâ€™t help. George would have been with me but he had to hang with his dog who was having a tough day. Still i came down to the junction and took over dog duty to free george and he still made it with 10 minutes to spare. Hell Yes! oh and I had the summit to myself. Hell Yes!
