This is my third year on the Randolph Mountain Club trail crew and I'm based out of the Stearns Lodge, a short walk down the road from Appalachia.  I thoroughly enjoyed the route.  Brookside is always a treat and this was my first time on the Scar Trail.  I am quite familiar with the area so I had no route finding slip-ups.

I did an early morning ascent and had the summit of Adams to myself which does not get any less spectacular no matter how many times you do it.  I had a leisurely descent visiting the Madison hut crew and Gray knob caretaker and picking chantrelles along Coldbrook on the way down.  Thanks for organizing this and I will highly recommend giving it a try to anyone with open years!
Enjoy the mountains!

My time was 1:27:42 according to my stop watch.  Unfortunately, my Strava lost GPS connection 11 mins in.

Best,
Jordan
