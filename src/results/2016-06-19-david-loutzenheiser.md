David Sandham (the Brit) and David Loutzenheiser decided that running in the Mt Washington Road Race on Saturday was not enough and decided to do the Mt Adams Challenge on Sunday June 19!  The weather was perfect, well a little warm, but little wind, and few bugs.  So off we went!

We missed the turnoff to Watson path, not realizing it until unexpectedly running into a co-worker at the next trail junction.  We paused, redirected, and back to the turnoff and up we went to the top.  Finished in 1:54.  We continued on to Mt Jefferson (at a fast hiking pace) and then back down via Crag Camp.

Thanks for inspiring us to try this new challenge!  I am sure we will both be back to try to beat our times.
