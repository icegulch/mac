I think you can see the GPS & summit photo from this link.

[Garmin Connect Route](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/9105378625)

A hail storm moved in when I got to the summit, so I had to take some safety precautions (and couldn't operate my iphone long ;-) so I didn't get as much of the sign as I was hoping for. The GPS data should be helpful, though!

I took 37 minutes off my 2019 time! (I also weigh about 37lbs less ;-)
