Time of 1:55:34 on July 31st, 2022. It was a gorgeous day! My second time doing the challenge after a first time in 2020. I was feeling good for valley way, but got pretty tired on Brookside. I barely missed the first turnoff to Watson, but caught myself at the next intersection. And I managed to navigate my way across Scar to Airline without incident, which was a massive improvement over my last effort! It was really nice above treeline, and Gulfside to Lowe's was a great ending.
