I'm reporting a successful MAC attempt on June 19, 2020.

2:01:45 rounded up.

Real hot for the first two miles, then good. The Brookside has had some improvements in a badly eroded spot. Nice to see, saved some seconds. It was so nice to lay on a snowfield near Adams 4 and get cold. Glorious.

Thank you. This is one of my favorite days yearly. #7.
