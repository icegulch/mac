Ticia Blanck and Doug Mayer ticked off the Mount Adams Challenge on June 11, 2016... with less than two minutes to spare! Weather was pretty good– wet rocks down low, drier above. It was Ticia's first time doing the MAC– and, in fact, her first time up Mount Adams! We had a nice walk down to Randolph, and within a few hours were enjoying the complimentary beers at Saalt Pub– thanks guys! :)
