I had a long trail run planned today, so thought I would take a shot at the MAC before it’s too cold.

I ran about 16:30 on the rail trail to warm up (lap 1) before tagging the Appalachia sign in the parking lot and starting lap 2, the MAC.

I ran the Valley Way stretch and most of the first mile or so of Brookside before I needed to switch to hiking quite often. I was watching for Watson Parh like a hawk because I missed it last year even though it was my 8th time.

I ran the Watson and much of the Scar where I could and hiked when I needed to. I knew Airline was a 1.2 mile rough staircase essentially with little opportunity to run.

I felt good through this point and at least knew I was giving it a solid effort.

After the beautiful, yet rugged climb up Airline, the Gulfside Trail is more runnable trail again. My legs were balking a bit at this but I knew I would be close. I hadn’t checked my timer yet.

I turned up Lowe’s Path at Thunderstorm Junction and just tried to be smart and efficient on the jumble of angled rock that makes up the path to the top. I tagged the summit sign and clicked for Lap 3 to start. I had made it.

In 2:07:21, by less than three minutes again but 29 seconds faster than last year. No complaints here.

I “ran” down Lowe’s Path, tagging Adams IV on the way by, and really only running often in the lower half of the trail but still moving somewhat quickly down the upper steeps.

A 2.5 mile rail trail run (lap 4) to ease the leg muscles some and finish up a glorious day. 9th time completed since 2014. I’ve been within 3 minutes of the cutoff for 2 years. This of course begs a question...
