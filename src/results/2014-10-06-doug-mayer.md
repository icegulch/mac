Finally back to home at the base of the Northern Presidentials, I decided to give the Mount Adams Challenge a go. It was time! It's been a good summer for me… I'm in great trail running condition, after a season of trail running and leading trips. And, best of all, I'm light (well, for me, anyway), which really seems to help on the uphills– almost as much as the jet pack. (<em>Damn, my secret is out</em>)

In the end, a summer of big hills paid off. 1:45:58. I bet that'll be my fastest time for a while. My Suunto doesn't pause on the screen with the results when you stop it, so I didn't get a snapshot of the time… but here's the log!

Fun moments: passing a few folks on the trail, and balancing my desire to be courtesy with my interest in cranking out a good time. (I'm not stopping… but I am saying hi!) And, of course, glancing up for a moment here and there when above treeline, to see the foliage in King Ravine from the Air Line, a view that will never get old for me.

It was a great afternoon: quiet on the trails, a beautiful view from the summit… and then a run down to beat sunset, arriving at Appalachia just as the forest was headed towards pitch black.

All in all, a great afternoon. Now, on to that beer at SAALT and the cappuccino at the White Mountain Cafe!
