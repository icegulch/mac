Back in 2014, I ran the Mount Adams Challenge in its first year after a suggestion from a friend. It sounded like a great time! I managed to hack my way to a successful time with about three minutes to spare that year. I managed just under 2 hours in 2015 and 2016 but my time this year was back above at 2:04:22.

I felt good this year though. Running the Valley Way and Brookside with short steps and a steady pace got me into the distance a bit. The last part of Brookside is rough. I knew I'd be power hiking there so I ran when I could early. The Watson and Scar went by with no confusion although I'm convinced there are an extra 0.2 miles hidden in this part. The Scar Trail is a gem and fun to run. The Airline section is another power hiking section for me due to the steepness and rough footing, but I was on good pace so somewhere in this mile I decided pulling in under 2:10 was a good goal and relaxed a bit.

I did not really have it in me to push for my PR even though I'm sure I did the first two miles faster and steadier than before. I enjoyed a slow jog along Gulfside after redirecting a slightly confused hiker toward the hut. Reaching Thunderstorm Junction, I picked my way over the jumbled boulders to the summit and enjoyed a few moments of gratitude, rest, and spectacular views on a perfect summer summit day before heading down the Airline. After four years of the MAC, I think it's becoming habit!
