Thanks for the challenge, it made me go for an adventure. I might have taken a wrong turn somewhere since my distance and total elevation gain where higher than the 5.3 mi and 4488 in the invite?

Here is the link to my trace.

Loved every stepâ€¦ even coming down and celebrating Independence Day.

Thanks for the beverage! I might try to improve my time later in the season and let you know.
