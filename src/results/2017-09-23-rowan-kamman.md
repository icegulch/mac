Today I made another attempt at the MAC route. I knew I was in much better shape than when I made last year's attempt and was confident of a better time. Plus, it had been over a year! Living in Burlington, it's always a treat to come over to the northern Prezis.


Anywho, I PR'ed by 10 minutes for a total of 1:25:47. It was hard. My lungs hurt now, along with my whole body! I'm very pleased with my improvement though. The weather in the alpine today was stupid nice; no wind at all and over 60 degrees. There's something wrong...it shouldn't ever get like that up there.
