        <p>
          Based on the <a href="http://runthealps.com/blog/leukerbads-70-minute-dash" target="_blank">Leukerbads 70 minute dash</a>, the Mount Adams Challenge is an entirely informal event to be undertaken by individuals seeking a personal challenge. It is not a race. Do it in a low-key, fun way on a schedule that works for you.

            You are responsible for your own safety. You are on your own in the mountains. Act with common sense. If you are uncertain of your ability, physical condition, or the weather, do not attempt the Mount Adams Challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Run with respect and good intention. Follow Leave No Trace's <a href="https://lnt.org/learn/7-principles" target="_blank">seven principles</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Be honest with yourself and others. No cheating!
